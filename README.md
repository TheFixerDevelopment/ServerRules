![ServerRules](http://preview.ibb.co/fnsoha/IMG_0028.png)

Many of us (including myself) put the server rules on signs. That's a matter of the past, because now, whatever it is, there will be no way for server rules to be lost. ServerRules is a plugin for PocketMine-MP that allows you to list the rules in the **/rules** command. They must be added, each one, in the **config.yml**. Up to 8 rules can be added.

```yml
# Enter the server rules below between the quotation marks
rule1: "1."
rule2: "2."
rule3: "3."
rule4: "4."
rule5: "5."
rule6: "6."
rule7: "7."
rule8: "8."
# Please do not try to add more rules, otherwise there will be problems loading the file information
...
```

# Commands
| Command | Usage | Description |
| ------- |  ----- | ----------- |
| `/rules` | `/rules` | Shows all the server rules |
