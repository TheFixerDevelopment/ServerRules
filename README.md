![ServerRules](http://preview.ibb.co/fnsoha/IMG_0028.png)
Many of us (including myself) put the server rules on signs. That's a matter of the past, because now, whatever it is, there will be no way for server rules to be lost. I give an example: someone has griefed the server. And if we're lucky, we can restore the backup. Anyway, ServerRules is a plugin for PocketMine-MP that allows you to list the rules in the /rules command. They must be added, each one, in the **config.yml**. Up to 8 rules can be added.

Example:
```yml
```
