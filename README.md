# Installation
This plugin needs to be converted to a .phar file before being installed on the server. You will find various tools to perform the conversion process. After the conversion, move the .phar file to the Plugins folder and restart the server. You will have to modify the file that will be created automatically that corresponds to config.yml and then you will have to restart the server.
